# cpp_json_practice
Practice understanding nlohmann's "[JSON for Modern C++](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)"

This was made to help incorporate JSON serialization in [my group's final project](https://github.com/SleepyLark/cs3505-Sprite-Editor) and to help everyone understand how it works (myself included) so everyone would be on the same page and be able to contribute.
